Hi, my name is Zhengtao Jiang👦. This is my blog.

Now I am a graduate student in HNU(Changsha) and research about AI and EDA.💪

On 16/10/2020, I build this blog with Hugo theme--Dream which is beautiful and is suitable to write some articles👌

One year ago, I made preparations for the graduate entrance exam at that time . I hoped there are  many things I want to do in the future,  including traveling🚄, working out🏋, reading📕,writing✒,photography📷.

Now ,here it is. Maybe one day, I can meet a better myself👏.
